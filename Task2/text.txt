Gao the Arsonist is a UK-based Alternative Hip Hop rapper and producer who expresses his melancholy take on life through a wide range of harsh tones. FORENSICS, his most recent experimental hip hop track, is a dark, abrasive exploration of identity and what it means to be estranged from one's cultural origins. It makes extensive use of the idea of a faceless, untraceable murderer committing horrible atrocities while leaving no evidence of their existence. The combination of burning lyricism and visceral production creates a sickeningly emotional experience.
